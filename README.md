# UFOs

## Overview of the analysis:
### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to allow users to filter a table containing UFO sighting date on Dana's webpage.  Table filters for city, state, country, and shape allow users to search the data multiple ways.  

## Results:

When Dana's webpage loads all the data is visible, what if someone wants to see just information based on specific information?  They can filter the date by the following categories: date, city, state, country, or shape.

To understand how the webpage works, we'll walk through applying a filter to the data.

First, we will filter by state.
1. Go to the filter "Enter a State" and enter the state abbreviation.  For this example, we will use California.
2. This will return all data associated with California.


3. Next, we will filter by city.  For this example, we will use Bakersfield.


You can also filter the data based on any filter category and when the user presses enter, the results will update.

## Summary:
### Drawbacks

One drawback to this website is that it is case sensitive.  If you type CA instead of ca, it will not populate any results.

### Additioanal Recommendations for Further Development
To help Dana make this webpage more beneficial, I would suggest increasing the amount of data in the set.  It currently only houses a small amount of data limited to January 2010.

I would also recommend standardizing the duration of the sighting.  This would allow us to easily create a filter for the duration as well.
